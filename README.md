# CS-250
For this course assignment, I wrote a C++ program that receives data from a text file, performs different mathematical operations on the data, and writes the results to another text file. The project's purpose was to demonstrate my knowledge of C++ programming as well as my ability to develop a functioning programm that matches industry requirements.
I feel I performed exceptionally well in creating the architecture of my program and organizing my code. I spent a large amount of time preparing and researching the most effective strategy to implement the project's numerous functions. I also utilized modular programming to make the program easier to comprehend and maintain by breaking it into smaller, more manageable components.
My program is no exception. There is always opportunity for development in each project. One way I could improve my code is to use more efficient techniques for mathematical calculations. For example, I may investigate more complex numerical approaches to enhance computation accuracy and speed. I could also make the program more secure by adding more strong error handling and input validation methods.
This project taught me skills that I can use to future projects or school. My expertise constructing a modular program, for example, will be valuable in establishing large-scale applications. My knowledge of C++ libraries and functions will also be useful when dealing with other programming languages.
I used various recommended practises to make the program manageable, readable, and adaptive. I utilized sensible variable names, commented to describe the operation of the code, and employed a consistent coding style throughout the program. I have extensively tested my program, both with valid and incorrect input data, to guarantee its robustness and adaptability to various conditions.
